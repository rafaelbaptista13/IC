'Believes that both business-to-business and business-to-consumer contracts should be covered; emphasises that the [optional instrument] must offer a very high level of consumer protection, in order to compensate consumers for the protection that they would normally enjoy under their national law; wishes for further explanation on how this could be achieved'.
... to support civil society, to support the interim transitional national council and Mr Jibril (we have had many meetings with him); to support security sector reform; to build on what the people told us that they wanted.
A more balanced approach has allowed us to have a joint motion for a resolution today which will be constructive and targeted at the opportunities for closer cooperation between Ukraine and the European Union, while judicial reform is carried out in the country and the anti-corruption measures implemented.
Above all, the European Union must refrain from taking sides in the conflict.
According to the Act of Accession, verification, by means of evaluation procedures, that the necessary conditions for the application of all parts of the Schengen acquis (data protection, the SIS, air borders, land borders, sea borders, police cooperation and visas) have been met by the new Member States is a precondition for the Council to decide on the abolition of checks at internal borders with those Member States. I did not endorse this document because taking into account the results of the evaluations and the necessary revisits carried out by teams of experts, the committee responsible has concluded that there are some outstanding issues that will require regular reporting and a follow-up at some point in the future.
Accordingly, we must assess expected conditions and specific circumstances and determine what we have to do to make sure that Europe exists and does not end up as a loser.
After 20 years, even Mr Medvedev had to admit that one cannot ignore the terrible and criminal heritage of Russian power. I recall the words of our colleague, Mr Swoboda, who yesterday asked for a full clearing up of Russian history, especially the atrocities of the Stalin era.
After the adoption of a general approach by the Council in March, we got down to business immediately, engaging in intense trialogue negotiations with Parliament and the Commission.
Air services agreements now fall into this category, as they cover an area to which the ordinary legislative procedure applies.
All the Members have had an opportunity to speak. I allowed them to speak for at least 15 seconds and even a minute in some cases, and the balance between the political groups has been fully respected.
Allow me now to turn to the six legislative proposals on economic governance, called the 'six-pack' in our common jargon. I will not go into detail as it is on the plenary agenda in its own right.
Although I am not entirely in favour of the resources released in this way being allocated to the Union's budget, as I think that the Millennium Development Goals should benefit, at least in part, I wished to vote for paragraph 171 to send a positive signal to the Commission and the Council regarding the implementation of this tax.
Although some issues remain unresolved, such as the negative impact on biodiversity of tar sands extraction and of some seal-derived products, I voted in favour not only because the public procurement problem has practically been resolved, but also because of the benefits to the Member States, and to prevent the negotiations from suffering any delays.
Although these businesses are not involved in door-to-door selling, they naturally make frequent deals with customers that are concluded with a handshake.
Among the conclusions to draw from it, it should be stressed that the running costs of these programmes are estimated to be some EUR 800 million per annum and that revenue will only reach EUR 80 million per annum by around 2030.
An innovation policy that is consistent and integrated, and has a long-term vision will enable us to leverage strengths and resolve weaknesses detected at regional level.
Annual growth rates of the market for GNSS-enabled products and services are estimated to be above 10%. The Commission should launch a comprehensive analysis to identify more precisely the possible scenarios and means of operation and exploitation post 2013.
Antibiotic resistance in livestock and domestic animals has become a problem in recent years.
Apart from the threat of accident or terrorist attack, there is also considerable evidence of adverse health effects along Ireland's eastern seaboard attributed to Sellafield discharges.
As Amnesty suggested, however, it is vital to link these with the TDIP report and with the follow-up that the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) has agreed to take up in a new own-initiative report.
As Mr Reul said, we must, of course, encourage excellence.
As a representative of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to pose a question to the President of the Commission, who has been busy dealing with the pictures that we have been seeing in recent weeks from the Mediterranean, where many people fleeing from the situation in Africa have made it to Europe, while some have also failed to make it. We have had to see the images of these stranded and dead people on the news.
As advocated by the rapporteur, I too urge the European Commission to continue applying pressure to approve these proposals, as the measures provided for in the agreement will only be truly effective at combating illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing if and when they are applied in a comprehensive, uniform and transparent manner, in order to avoid loopholes that could be easily exploited by the IUU fishing operators.
As far as the EU's role in multilateral security organisations is concerned, it has been said that the regulations which make it possible for the European Union to benefit from NATO funding should be streamlined.
As has been said many times, we are very close to achieving the goal, but at the same time it is important that we are successful in the voting today and in July. I would also like to thank Mr Kármán from the Hungarian Presidency, who has done a splendid job.
As part of our preparatory work, the Commission is exploring the idea of candidate countries joining the initiative after 2019. I would also inform you that a number of cities in other third countries have already shown an interest.
As regards our emerging strategic partners around the globe, we have witnessed recently how culture can become an integral part of our external relations. I am more committed than ever to advancing further this very important dimension of our European agenda for culture.
As some of my fellow Members have pointed out, if these points were to be clarified, the Commission would be well advised to consult the European Parliament when issuing a mandate.
As such, its aim is to create a full picture of when, where, how and on which animals the antimicrobials are actually used today, without creating additional financial or administrative burdens for farmers or other animal owners, taking into account the fact that farming practice and intensity is different from one Member State to another.
As the protocol to the current Fisheries Partnership Agreement will expire in the future, the Commission's intention to open renewal negotiations with the other party is logical.
As we come into the autumn, we need a serious examination, and we have put down some 60 questions to the Commission on this matter, with the aim of identifying where we are getting poor implementation.
As yet, the Canadian Government believes this directive discriminates between Canadian oil imports and oil imports from other countries. I consider the agreement to be too early.
Assistance must also be allocated in a targeted manner, i.e. linked to climate change.
At a time when there are no watertight compartments between countries, we need to listen very carefully to the uproar of events.
At the Council meeting on 12 May 2011 the Presidency plans to initiate discussions on the various ideas on the Schengen acquis which have been put forward by the Commission in its communication on migration of 4 May.
At the same time, European Union countries must also be aware that it is in their interest for Romania and Bulgaria to join Schengen because they will be able to make their own contribution to the security of all Member States and extend the Schengen area, which is set to strengthen the integration process within the European Union and the common area of freedom, security and justice.
At the same time, it is imperative to ask misleading business directory companies to cease and desist their deliberately misleading business activities, because they are contrary to the spirit of the Union's competition policy.
At the same time, we have also got to grips with the problem of fraud, where other countries are deceived.
Authorising and legitimising pollution if it is economically viable for the company is not a path to sustainability. I believe that the EU's priority should be to impose more stringent measures on pollution caused by heavy goods vehicles and to commit decisively to rail freight.
Based on the opinion of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, this report on the proposal for a Council regulation on denominations and technical specifications of euro coins intended for circulation concludes that the proposal in question is restricted to the straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance.
Before a European Arrest Warrant is issued, therefore, consideration should be given to how serious the offence is, what the expected penalty is and whether there is a simpler way of dealing with the matter.
Bosnians, meanwhile, are characterised by great friendliness and hospitality. I recently read the reminiscences of a Polish student who took part in a student exchange in Sarajevo - she did not meet a single foreign student who was there as part of the exchange who did not like Sarajevo.
Brussels, which is considered by some to be second only to Washington as a mecca for lobbyists, needs proper regulations and clearly-defined principles of cooperation between decision makers and representatives of various interest groups.
But is he aware that, in his own government, one of the first acts of the Home Secretary, Theresa May, when coming into office was to opt into the European Investigation Order, which means we now cannot opt out and will be stuck with whatever comes through the legislative sausage machine, because this will be subject to qualified majority voting and the final outcome is something we cannot determine? Is this another case of Tory double-speak, where they speak out against the acts of the European Union here but endorse them back home in our own parliament?
But we know that Greece has no intention of leaving the eurozone. I am in constant contact with both the Greek authorities and the main opposition party and I know very well that they do not want to leave the eurozone.
By being an inn, Cervantes meant lying still, complaining that one is ignored and remaining static.
By selecting the right way forwards in the area of contract law, it is possible to contribute in a significant way to the better functioning of the Single Market and to making its full potential available to businesses (especially small and medium-sized ones) and consumers.
Can the Commission provide information on consumer awareness of the quality food schemes? How can recognition of the PDO, PGI and TSG labels be improved and made more relevant to consumers, in particular, in Member States that have few registered products?
Chemistry has made possible vaccines and antibiotics that have doubled our life expectancy, and it is key to developing new energy sources and improving food.
Climate change is threatening European forests, with an increase in forest fires, with diseases passing from one country to another and putting entire species at risk, and with disasters caused by extreme weather conditions.
Coming up with a viable solution to the sovereign debt crisis and the need to strengthen the euro, return to a path of sustainable growth and create new jobs depend on efficient coordination between Member States and strengthening the Stability and Growth Pact.
Commissioner, just like you, we want to stick to the procedure ensuring that this entire process is conducted correctly, and we await the final opinion of the Venice Commission, although it is now clear from the preliminary conclusions presented in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs by the Secretary of the Venice Commission, Mr Markert, that the current Hungarian constitution is, in a number of points, controversial to say the least.
Conclusion number one reads: 'in considering the direct causes of the Fukushima accident, we see no reason for curtailing the operation of nuclear power plants or other nuclear facilities in the UK'. Conclusion two reads: 'in response to the Fukushima accident, the UK nuclear power industry has reacted responsibly and appropriately, displaying leadership for safety and a strong safety culture in its response to date'. Conclusion four reads: 'to date, the consideration of the known circumstances of the Fukushima accident has not revealed any gaps in scope or depth of the safety assessment principles for nuclear facilities in the UK'.
Consider this: only a year ago, the euro area Member States agreed on a conditional loan package to Greece in order to prevent a meltdown of our financial system.
Cooperation between the Commission and Parliament is essential, not only for a good start in shaping the proposal, but also for a happy end to the negotiations which are extremely difficult in the present context.
Countless factors have a bearing on this growth, which is not unconnected to the deepening of the crisis of capitalism and its social effects in many countries.
Croatia, as a candidate country for EU membership, has a duty to adapt its legal system to the system which is in force in the countries of the Union. I think that Croatia's participation in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction is extremely important, particularly because Croatia is a transit route.
Currently, too many young people are dropping out of school too early and not enough are taking advantage of higher education.
Despite already being the object of resolutions of this Parliament, the last of which was in 2010, the old request that the country of origin be marked and that information be made available about the origin of various goods has been postponed.
Despite the success of this vote, given the cross-border implications for the safety and health of European citizens, I regret the minor role that Parliament has been given in nuclear matters as it has only a consultative role in this matter.
Do more in Syria and do not lend your support to half-baked solutions.
Domestic workers are currently excluded from the Maternity Leave Directive and from any European legislation guaranteeing the right to maternity protection, and they are not even covered by the Health and Safety Framework Directive.
During the negotiations with the EU Council of Ministers, the inclusion of new provisions in the regulation was very important, such as those requiring the indication of animal-derived materials in textile products and conducting a study to determine whether there is a causal link between allergic reactions and chemicals or mixtures used in textile products.
Early years education has far-reaching implications on children's future development and their chances of success later on. Investments made during this period reduce the costs incurred later relating to health matters, the crime rate and antisocial behaviour.
Enforcement measures to correct excessive macroeconomic imbalances in euro area (
Essentially, this prevents the creation of an internal market in the European Union that is more geared towards and favourable to small business.
Europe needs an ever-growing number of its school pupils and students to come into contact with a new social, educational and cultural model. I believe that the mobility programmes aimed at young people will successfully bring about a real change in the attitude of Europe's young people and create a shared vision for them about what Europe stands for, in areas from education, science and research to culture and our common values.
European companies have had improved access to telecommunications, car manufacturing, retail and the insurance sector in Japan, and that has not damaged the Japanese economy but has, in fact, encouraged innovation and development in Japan.
Evaluation is nothing if the results are not presented, discussed, questioned, and indeed either accepted or sometimes rejected, by the very stakeholders that it aims to serve, and, of course, Parliament plays a vital role in this process, not only bringing to bear a broad cross-section of experience from political and public life but, just as importantly, from the many fields of deep knowledge held by Members.
Even though all of the requirements for an inclusive, sustainable and competitive Europe are included, there is nevertheless no way in the world that we could finance everything all at once from the EU budget. I want a realistic and implementable negotiating strategy and this has not been achieved, as no clear priorities have been set in this report. I therefore abstained in the final vote.
Everyone is free to react and criticise the content, because everything works out through debates and interchanges of opinions in the European Union, and it is true that many Member States have criticised the content already.
Faced with this inevitable catastrophe, the 2020 strategy had to aim at increasing the attractiveness of vocational education and training.
Finally, I congratulate Commissioner Oettinger for finding a consensus on the criteria and the practical details of implementing the stress tests for nuclear installations, which will enable us to ensure the highest safety levels in the world.
Finally, I would like to note how very important it is for the Commission's proposal to incorporate and rely even more fully on the strategy document 'GDP and beyond: measuring progress in a changing world'. A consistent, systematic approach will perhaps be more crucial than anything else in efforts to improve the way quality of life is measured.
Finally, in a context in which a significant part of the economy depends on multinational companies, there is also a need for organisations to be socially responsible.
Finally, the rapporteur also covered one fundamental issue: opposition to absolute strategic autonomy as the final outcome of the CSDP.
Financial markets and institutions have to take into account, as part of their corporate social responsibility, the interests of all parties involved, including clients, shareholders and employees.
First, the Commission calls on the EU Member States to exercise a proportionality test when they call for an Arrest Warrant, and to fill the gaps where their legislation fails to fully comply with the framework decision setting up the Arrest Warrant.
Firstly, minimum rules on the right to interpretation and translation, which were adopted already in 2010.
Firstly, we need to encourage the mobility and attractiveness of cultural factors, such as the mobility of artists, cultural workers and works of art and, secondly, we need to ensure that specific funding and economic support policies are put in place in the cultural sector, such as access to funds via the European Investment Bank.
Following the disastrous euro rescue package, which simply involved the net contributors taking a hit for the mismanagement and corruption in a few southern states, the plan is now to ask the already overburdened citizens of the net contributor countries to cough up even more money.
For all these reasons, I shall be voting in favour of this motion for a resolution.
For example, the report states that the purpose of development policy should not be to defend the EU's interests, but rather those of the most vulnerable populations on the planet.
For me, education must be a political priority.
For that reason, it gives me great pleasure to hear Commissioner Reding say that Member States will be required to exercise a proportionality test and to take care not to issue arrest warrants for minor offences.
For the time being, the Commission has no plans to amend the framework directive on occupational safety and health.
For this reason, I welcome the support the EU has pledged in order to help build this new state.
For us, it is not about making transport more expensive, as has just been claimed.
Fourthly, the coverage of other important Union policies beyond electronic communications: here, I am talking about the environment, transport or research and the need to make a substantial amount of spectrum available.
From the outset, parents are thus seen as incapable, irresponsible and childish.
Furthermore I wish to emphasise here what is, in my view, the most important aspect of the agreement reached with the Council, namely, the commitment by the European Commission to present, by 30 September 2013, after it has carried out a suitable impact assessment, a report accompanied by legislative proposals regarding indication of origin labelling, traceability and the use of new technologies.
Furthermore, if the free trade agreement is to reflect each party's level of development, it cannot overlook such fundamental standards as the prohibition of child labour, for example.
Furthermore, the EU's diverse cultural landscape gives us the distinction of being the most attractive tourist destination in the world. I welcome the concrete suggestions presented in this report for the involvement of civil society, artists, educators, students and entrepreneurs in shaping the content of external cultural relations.
Furthermore, this surveillance should be broadened to prevent harmful macroeconomic imbalances, with a guarantee that, in future, it will go beyond fiscal policy and that its remit will be extended to early detection and prevention of potentially harmful economic imbalances, too.
Given his experience in this area, I believe I can safely endorse his evaluation, and his demands for external border security.
Given the added value of Commission aid, and the Commission's new role in coordinating the Union's and the Member States' development policy (Article 210 TFEU), the share of ODA channelled through the EU budget should remain at least stable.
Given this and the importance of the office of President of the European Central Bank, I believe that Mr Draghi fulfils all the conditions to perform the mandate for which he has now been nominated with skill and dedication.
Greening events dealing with the environment in Pillar 1 must be clear, properly designed and easy to measure, and funding for Pillar 2 must be strong and fair.
Having consulted with the political groups, I would like to submit to the House the following proposed amendments to the final version of the draft agenda:
Helping other countries to construct stable democratic societies in countries governed by the rule of law, where human rights are observed and freedom of speech is guaranteed, with a solid judicial system, territorial defence and armed forces, is a commendable plan. I hope that we will succeed in putting it into effect on a wider scale, making even more efficient use of funds.
High unemployment among young people is one of the Commission's top priorities and is one of my foremost personal concerns.
How can you talk about regional cooperation programmes with third countries when the democrats of Tunisia and Libya are seeing us closing our countries' borders? Is it possible to talk about that? We cannot say ambiguous things.
However, Article 51 of the Charter states that its provisions are addressed to the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the EU, with due regard for the principle of subsidiarity, and to the Member States only when they are implementing EU law.
However, I do not believe that the register's primary aim is solely to combat corruption as the instances of corruption have, however, been very few and far between.
However, I voted in favour of the tabled amendments, which substantially mitigate the negative impact of the proposal: safeguard clause, limit of one year and the human rights clause.
However, and this concerns Mr Stavrakakis, there is also a need for improved cooperation with the other funds in this area and, in particular, the fund for rural development.
However, despite all the efforts of the Commission to improve its impact assessment as well as those that we have made in this regard in the European Parliament, the quality of the impact assessment is still in need of improvement.
However, if we transfer more responsibilities to the EU, expecting it to finance ambitious projects, while, at the same time, cutting funding, then we will be guilty of acting against solidarity within the European Union because we will encourage internal divisions in the fight for funds, for example, in cohesion policy.
However, it is also absolutely our duty not to leave our producers high and dry when it is through no fault of their own that they have found themselves in this situation that threatens their very survival.
However, just as we remember the victims from the Baltic States, we also think of the Armenians, who were expelled from Turkey at the start of the last century.
However, some western German regions require European aid, as do parts of the United Kingdom.
However, the choice made today strengthens the cooperation between the two parties, and promotes a partnership capable of developing sustainable fishing and of exploiting the resources of Seychelles in a balanced way.
However, the reality in this and in other sectors which have seen increased liberalisation, such as rail transport, belies these promises of benefits.
However, there are very many domains which can contribute to synergies or economies of scale: the European External Action Service, humanitarian aid and civil protection, pooling of resources in defence, research and innovation, major infrastructure projects (especially in the areas of energy and transport).
However, this must not result in those countries and those farmers which already have very ambitious environmental programmes in the second pillar being discriminated against by this new approach. A solution needs to be found here that is fair to both sides.
However, we came to the view that we needed to look a little more into what was behind this case.
However, we will also need public participation across national borders.
Hungary, Latvia, Romania, outside the euro area, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, the United Kingdom and Greece too, apart from a break of four years, when our lot were in. In other words, your economic model does not work.
I also consider it very important to support lifelong learning and activities that are not just for young people. I would definitely like to emphasise equal opportunities for all, not only in terms of gender equality, but also for disabled or otherwise disadvantaged people.
I am concerned that the current budgetary constraints imposed on Member States may lead to greater restrictions on investment in research and innovation, with obvious negative effects on European growth and competitiveness. I therefore call on the Commission to consider leveraging the resources of the common strategic framework for funding these sectors, particularly the research and innovation sectors of the European Union.
I am in favour of this own-initiative report since it deals with promoting corporate social responsibility as a voluntary motivational tool designed to stimulate business growth.
I am therefore in favour of the creation of additional indicators for measuring medium- and long-term social and economic progress, for example, indicators that take account of climate change, biodiversity, resource efficiency and social inclusion.
I am voting for this report because it includes a range of concerns highlighted by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament (S&D), by acknowledging the limitations of gross domestic product (GDP) and the need to include additional indicators to measure economic and social progress in the medium and long terms. I would also draw attention to the establishment of clear and measurable indicators that take into account climate change, biodiversity, efficient resource utilisation and social inclusion, which could help lead to a more inclusive society based on knowledge, and to lower carbon emissions.
I believe it is, therefore, very important that the final resolution includes a clear call for full effective investigation into the European Union Member States' complicity and their renditions and secret detention programmes.
I believe that we are witnessing a trend whereby national constitutions are seen as an area where there is no room for political debate among European democracies.
I congratulate my colleague Mr Pieper and all the rapporteurs for the excellent report that was presented.
I endorsed adoption of the directive. I think the decision to extend the financing of Eurovignettes by external costs, in other words, by the costs of environmental pollution and noise, is more advisable than the previous version, which was restricted only to covering the costs of road infrastructure.
I fully support Ms Pack's initiative and I want to ask Parliament to support it and to do everything we can to include Sarajevo as a European cultural capital. I believe that, if we all want this, it absolutely can be possible, because it would be very disappointing if our ideas and common sense were to be blocked by bureaucracy.
I have taken note of the assessment of the report on the policy options presented in the Green Paper and the support for the innovative solution of an optional instrument, which means no harmonisation but giving consumers and businesses a choice of having a Europe-wide system. I have also seen the support for an instrument applicable in both B2C and B2B transactions, which favours a material scope covering sales contracts, contracts for the supply of digital content and some service contracts. I have taken very good note of what has been said by Parliament, namely, that any future instrument, whatever it looks like, should give consumers a high level of protection in order not to deprive them of the protection they would otherwise enjoy under national law.
I hope that this kind of problem, whereby the Council discharge has been postponed by Parliament, will never come up in the future again so I ask that even during the Hungarian Presidency we should have a political discussion and agreement.
I particularly welcome the call for at least 70% of budget funding to be spent on territorial cooperation in cross-border collaboration, on the one hand, and for the funding for territorial cooperation to be increased from a level of 2.5% in the current programming period to at least 7% of total budget funding in the next programming period.
I should like to express my pride at the European Parliament's broadly favourable view in support of the appointment of the new President of the European Central Bank (ECB), Mario Draghi.
I support the report on the mid-term review of the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Union for research, technological development and demonstration activities because I believe that it truly reflects what has been achieved, as well as existing problems.
I supported today's report calling for a joint register of lobbyists and interest groups to be set up. This is a first step towards greater transparency in both the European Parliament and Commission. A 'transparency register' will improve ease of access for citizens wishing to find specific information regarding which organisations and individuals have contact with both MEPs and Commission officials.
I therefore welcome the adoption of this report, which represents a major step forward in consumer protection. I also welcome the option taken by the Council of restricting this directive to door-to-door and Internet sales - a market that is expanding significantly, but in which consumers still feel a little lost - and I approve of the simplification measures adopted, not least the possibility of consumers, but not companies, rescinding contracts by telephone.
I think this resolution on the EU-India Free Trade Agreement should be rejected.
I voted against the potential adoption of EU harmonisation of credit rating agencies as the standards may vary, and necessarily so, between Member States.
I voted for the report because the transmission of pathogenic bacteria carrying AMR genes constitutes a particular threat to people, through the intake of said bacteria and/or through daily contact with animals. I believe that commitment to research is essential, as it contributes to the development of antimicrobials as an effective tool in the fight against diseases afflicting both people and animals.
I voted for this report because I believe that the cultural and creative industries should constitute an added value for the Union. A European statute for artists based on favourable working conditions and tax regimes would promote Europe as a dynamic and challenging environment in which to live and work, making it attractive to skilled and creative individuals.
I voted for this resolution because the statement identifies the main problems and priorities for the EU in the new Multiannual Financial Framework. I should particularly like to emphasise the call contained in the resolution for the Commission to present proposals for an effective and efficient EU common agricultural policy (CAP), which would more fairly distribute direct payments between Member States and farmers, and strengthen the link between delivery of public goods to society and support payments to farmers. I fully support the call for the funds allocated to the CAP in the budget year 2013 to be maintained at the same level for the next financial programming period also, so that the CAP can fulfil its expanded objectives and tasks.
I voted in favour of granting 2009 discharge to the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex) because, as the report states, its accounts and transactions, taken as a whole, are shown in the analysis to be positive, regular and legal.
I voted in favour of the alternative motion for a resolution on corporate governance in financial institutions as it tables proposals which would ensure improvements in corporate governance structures throughout the EU, taking into account the fact that the financial sector must respond to the needs of the real economy, contribute to sustainable growth and demonstrate greater social responsibility.
I voted in favour of the report on the Protocol extending to customs security measures the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Economic Community and the Principality of Andorra, since it encourages trade between both parties while ensuring a high level of customs security and consistency between the agreement and the EU acquis.
I voted in favour of this document, codifying Council Directive 80/181/EEC of 20 December 1979 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to units of measurement and the repeal of Directive 71/354/EEC.
I voted in favour of this report because I agree that demographic changes and increasing longevity mean that working lives will be more varied, and retraining and participation in lifelong learning have already become a necessity.
I voted in favour of this report, but I think we should have been clearer and stronger in our demands when it comes to the mechanism of sanctions and penalties.
I voted to give discharge to Frontex, but observe that the Court of Auditors reported, for the second year running, that the agency paid out amounts on the basis of unilateral grant decisions signed by the agency, while the rules in force make no provision for this type of instrument. I note that the amount paid out was more than EUR 28 000 000 in 2009, and was EUR 17 000 000 in 2008. I welcome, nevertheless, the agency's initiative, made in response to the Court's observation, of signing a framework Partnership Agreement with Member State border authorities.
I want to raise one issue concerning Article 17 in the proposed Convention, which is about the role of agencies. I think this is something that we really should be looking at at European level because, increasingly, it is being seen as a weak link in many of the issues that we are facing.
I welcome the Council's annual report and the efforts made to develop a European foreign policy. I consider it of the utmost importance to adopt a position which is harmonious with the Member States' foreign policies, since such cohesion will lead to peace, security, solidarity and conflict prevention at international level.
I welcome the fact that Parliament is particularly pressing for agreements concluded by the European Union to include mutual recognition of aviation security and safety standards, as well as better safeguards for the protection of passenger rights.
I welcomed this document because this report is a response to the Commission's Communication on the mid-term review of the autonomous European Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) (Galileo and EGNOS), which assesses the process and implementation so far and launches the debate on its future governance, exploitation and financing.
I would also like to call on the Commission to concentrate more, when performing impact assessments, on the transparency of the entire assessment process, to strive harder for its independence, and not to aim for just one solution to a problem in its proposals, but to assess multiple variant solutions to a specific situation independently. I would also like to call for a simplification of the process of public consultations, and an extension of the deadlines for submitting concrete proposals, including the possibility of submitting proposals in all official languages of the Union.
I would like to ask what the position of the European Commission is regarding the restructuring of government debt.
I would like to make five comments.
I would like to urge the Commission to speed up the gathering of research from all Member States, but also to support new research into antibiotics that would be effective for humans and would save lives.
If Europe wants to successfully achieve the ambitious objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, which place particular stress on innovation, research and training, it will have to invest in better qualified young people, opting for forms of education that are more geared towards future incorporation into the labour market and paying particular attention to knowledge that really prepares young people for the future.
If courts in the European Union are now ruling that Dublin II is to be ineffective - in other words, that refugees are not to be deported to their states of first arrival - then we must ask the Commission how committed it will be to taking action against those states that are obviously not currently implementing the existing law.
If that is what we are being asked to think, it really is unbelievable.
If the supply of energy resources is not exploited as a political tool, if it applies equal, transparent and non-discriminatory rules to all market players, if Russia makes an objective choice to make use of our existing mutual dependence in the field of energy in a collaborative way, based on specific, fair and legally binding principles, we shall be able to speak of a new era in the development of a united Europe.
If we agree that the value of the European Union is much more than the sum of the 27 Member States that comprise it, if we are in favour of high quality, responsible agriculture, if we want to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, if we want to help our Mediterranean neighbours in their transition towards democracy, if we want to keep investing in research and innovation, if we want to carry on fighting climate change and investing in education, training and Erasmus grants, if we still believe in the cohesion policy as a tool for sustainable development and solidarity between our countries, and if we still support, for example, trans-European energy and transport networks - in short, if we still want more Europe - then we must call for a bigger budget for the European Union.
If we fail - and I say we and I really mean us all - they will simply say that 'Europe' has failed.
If we want to implement the instrument efficiently, this naturally represents a transfer of powers from the national capitals here to Brussels.
If, today, we bring in economic sanctions, we can expect that the scandalous trials and the scandalous repression will finally end, because it is only this language which Lukashenko understands.
Improving the Member States' development and growth plans, optimising the coordination of budgetary policies and strengthening the procedures for monitoring deficits and national debt are just some of the priorities to be pursued.
In 2013, 800 MHz will be freed up, in 2015, 1 200 MHz, and that is badly needed if Europe wants to remain amongst the global frontrunners.
In North Africa and the Arab world, that destination will not be reached quickly or without setbacks, but building deep democracy is the only way that destination will be reached at all.
In a speech on 7 April of this year, your colleague, Commissioner Potočnik, announced that, despite the Commission having avoided this issue and done nothing for many years, he intended presenting a communication in the autumn of this year in which he would tackle the problem, in particular with regard to implementation of existing regulations and an improved inspection system, as well as a broadening of the scientific base.
In addition, I believe that if a Member State would like to extend the scope of application of European law to domestic transactions as well, it should be free to do so. It is very true to say that this is not the solution to every problem.
In addition, the package we put forward last week urges rational reflection, taking into account short-term needs for strengthened external borders as well as a broader approach to asylum and migration.
In anticipation of the White Paper, the legislation now envisaged requires the Member States and the Commission to take the next steps towards a more sustainable and interoperational transport system, with a harmonised charging system internalising more external costs.
In conclusion, therefore, I believe it is necessary that the 2012 budget is able to respond to the challenges Europe is facing in a more concrete manner.
In fact, Agriculture Ministers are holding an extraordinary Council meeting today to address E coli.
In fact, the ability to recreate something offered to us and, on that basis, give rise to something new, is fundamental to the development of any economy and, above all, to achieving social welfare.
In its initial assessment of the potential FTA between the EU and India, the Centre for the Analysis of Regional Integration at Sussex concluded that any gains would depend on the extent to which the text identified and dealt with the key areas which the Commissioner specifically mentioned, such as government procurement, services, investment in trade facilitation, etc.
In my country's constitution, there is no mention of this issue, and so when will the European Parliament be holding a debate on the Italian constitution? Moreover, it is rather strange because, in my country, the only party that wants to change the constitution is Mr Berlusconi's centre-right party.
In my opinion, the establishment of high quality international cooperation in the fight against the illegal drugs trade, not only at the European level but especially at the global level, would be one way to improve the effectiveness of the fight against this kind of trade.
In my view, there will be no multiannual budgets from 2014 onward so long as those declarations from Member States are not given.
In order to avoid red tape and facilitate companies' access to European funding, simpler and more transparent procedures are absolutely vital.
In order to prevent this crisis becoming any worse, therefore, we need to take action regarding the fisheries sector's problems; swift and far-reaching action.
In other words, with these problems of a railway alternative, the truth is that the agreement on the Eurovignette is now imposing even greater burdens on the transportation of products by road, which, in the peripheral countries, particularly in the south and in the east, are products of little or limited added value.
In particular, efforts should be made to find a satisfactory solution to the problem of rules of origin so that products from other North American Free Trade Agreement members do not follow in the wake of Canadian products.
In practical terms, the conclusions show that, while attention has been focused on improving long-term competitiveness, the objectives of improving the environment, enhancing quality of life and promoting coordination and communication have not been implemented strongly enough.
In response to rumours about a cut in funding under the second pillar of the common agricultural policy, I repeat that I am in favour of guaranteeing adequate financial resources for rural development, also.
In terms of horizontal agreements, it is also important to align existing bilateral agreements with EU law, so as to ensure greater legal certainty, increase transparency and provide additional benefits in terms of simplification, while ensuring that all Union airlines will enjoy the same rights.
In the European Union, we also have countries that are facing the same kind of difficulties because of very high levels of expenditure.
In the communication, the Commission suggests various new initiatives in several priority areas for further action to be taken.
In the final analysis, irrespective of all the transparency achieved, it all comes down to the moral compass of each Member of this House, as this dictates what he thinks is right, whom he meets and whom he decides not to meet, whom he listens to and whom he decides not to listen to. After all, people also contact us using many other different communication channels.
In the light of this, it is difficult to understand why the conservative, liberal and eurosceptic Members of this House have blindly attempted to toughen up the text proposed by the Commission.
In the plenary sitting of 6 April 2011, the President announced, in accordance with Rule 6(2) of the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure, that he had received a letter from the National Anti-Corruption Department (Prosecutor's Office of the High Court of Cassation and Justice of Romania) on 5 April 2011 requesting the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of Adrian Severin.
In the wake of the financial crisis and the ongoing need to reduce budget deficits across Europe, Parliament must recognise that the cohesion budget cannot continue to grow, unchecked.
In this context, I would like particularly to refer to the debate on origin labelling for slaughter cattle which needs to be resolved, as well as tariff-related and technical obstacles, such as protracted approval procedures for EU products.
In this regard, I confirm that I have authorised my staff to continue down our chosen path, because the Commission has always supported origin labelling both for products made in the European Union and for those that are imported.
In this respect, I have to say that your refusal and that of the Council to allow the European Parliament to participate in establishing macroeconomic indicators through delegated acts does not seem to me to be the right approach.
In this sense, the report suggests a single strategic framework for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), the European Social Fund (ESF) and the European Fisheries Fund (EFF). Ensuring a common approach to these various regional funds will also serve to prevent overlapping and confusion for those economic operators at regional and local level who are interested in receiving European funding for a particular project.
In view of the above, such a system cannot be successfully introduced without penalties, and without restrictive penalties, as some have said.
In view of this change, the Committee on Transport and Tourism decided to draw up an own-initiative report with the aim of setting out some general principles on how air agreements should be evaluated, covering both their substance and the procedures the Committee might adopt to ensure it is well informed throughout the course of negotiations, and has an opportunity to express its priorities well before being confronted with the yes/no choice of consent.
Increasing the pace of research and innovation is crucial for introducing a fair and competitive economic model, ensuring jobs for the future, moving towards sustainable resource management, facing up to energy challenges and stimulating a knowledge-based society.
Indeed, my colleague, Mr Mann, referred to the visit there: the previous speaker is obviously not listening to what is going on in this debate.
Indian railways - to give you an example, 17 000 trains transport 18 million passengers every day, and there are plans to build a further 25 000 kilometres of track in the next 10 years - are one of the many markets that could potentially be opened up with this free trade agreement.
Instead of being viewed solely as a means of helping people to get better jobs, upskilling must give them the opportunity to shape the jobs of the future and, hence, contribute actively to an innovative economy.
International cooperation aimed at promoting these countries' self-sufficiency and independence is the right path towards achieving social and political peace at international level, which will not only fundamentally affect the beneficiary populations, but will also lead to the resolution of Europe's immigration problems. I therefore support increased European funding for this cause, as well as the creation of a financial instrument focused exclusively on it.
Is it possible to abandon penalties, or is the penalty system a restrictive system? Fifteen years ago, when I was still a student, I learnt about the convergence criteria, and their mandatory nature.
It also costs our farmers a lot of money and dangerously undermines consumer confidence in our agricultural products and agri-food industry, which are still undoubtedly the safest and most strictly controlled in the world.
It brings together in one policy cycle the two arms of economic recovery: financial stability that is based on fiscal consolidation, reflected in stability and convergence programmes, and structural reforms for a smart, sustainable, socially-inclusive and job-creating growth.
It does not affect my colleagues in Ireland or ourselves at all because even though we are in the IMF - and we are broke as a country - we are well above the European average in GDP terms; so whether there is an intermediate category or not does not affect us.
It happens wherever people from different countries meet and bring together their various experiences: the examples of this in Europe are very numerous and it is good that we have so much to say about mobility.
It has seen numerous conflicts since its independence from the United Kingdom in 1956.
It is a guarantee of support for the least-developed regions and disadvantaged groups, leading to balanced social and territorial development in the Union, and a course of action that has great significance for the 27 Member States, which are required to lay down strategic territorial development guidelines through the increasingly active involvement of the social partners.
It is about providing the transparency needed to know how Member States manage themselves, so that we may send them warning signals in time. I welcome the fact that the European Parliament followed this practice with close attention; in this European semester we encourage the Member States to maintain stricter budgetary management, and, at the same time, we lay down the basis for the practice of seeking growth in hard work and creativity.
It is also important that in order to develop the linguistic competence of deaf children, they must first learn their mother tongue (sign language), which will allow them to become truly multilingual in the future.
It is also, of course, partly because of the anticipated impact of the South Korean free trade agreement on Japanese exports, but I think that, in addition, it reflects recognition of Japan's limited experience with opening up.
It is clear that dividing the competences of the committees creates some areas of overlap between which it is difficult to distinguish, so I believe that this clarification is a positive step and that the proposed new wording will enable greater consistency in using Rule 51 of the Rules of Procedure.
It is down to the EU to preserve its image by strengthening its commitment to ITER and demanding that its partners do the same.
It is even more difficult when the debtor is domiciled in another Member State.
It is important for Europe to make good use of its potential in the process of promoting itself in the world.
It is important to establish a European Monetary Fund, managed under Union rules and financed in particular with the revenues from the fines, in order to safeguard financial stability of the euro area as whole.
It is inseparable from preventing forest fires, disasters which decimate extensive areas of forest annually in southern Europe, particularly in Portugal.
It is necessary to emphasise that GDP is a measure of production and does not reflect environmental sustainability, resource efficiency, social inclusion or social progress in general.
It is not only important for children, for the very young children I have been talking about and the young people that my colleague has been talking about, but it is also important for the future of Europe. I therefore strongly support what the Commissioner has said, that Member States should now continue to invest in education and should not be using the economic climate to make cuts, because making cuts in education would be the worse possible thing to do.
It is obvious that today in Europe, even the biggest Member States do not have the necessary influence or leverage to talk on an equal basis with the United States or China and other powers, but together, the European Union can make a difference.
It is politically unacceptable and economically dangerous for these agencies, which have played such a negative role in the present crisis, to continue to have the right, granted by the EU itself, to rate not only companies, but also the economies of the Member States.
It is something well thought out and it is something that will lead to further legislation and proposals in the light of the European Council meeting in June, which will have as a theme - also planned for a long time - migration issues.
It is therefore based on mutual trust of the systems in force, whether in the EU or in Canada, and provides for obligations and methods of cooperation so that the importing authority can issue its own certificate on the aeronautical product, part or appliance without duplicating all the assessments done by the exporting authority.
It is therefore obvious that President Assad and his whole family need to be included on the list - not tomorrow, not the day after tomorrow, but today.
It is true that the review aims to improve SMEs' access to financing, but it fails to mention social and environmental issues and does not even refer to the European Commission's plan for a Social Business Initiative, announced for the end of this year.
It is very important, however, that continuity of service is guaranteed, as a (temporary) limitation or degradation of GPS signals will have tremendous effects on our economy and society, without other independent GNSS systems in place.
It is worth pointing out that the definition of domestic workers in the draft ILO Convention is very wide.
It must be based on the road map agreed by the local players and must be endorsed by the SADC, the African Union and the international community.
It provides timely evidence of the progress in implementation throughout the EU-27 and promotes transparency of measures through integration with the Community's priorities.
It should also be taken into account that non-recyclable nuclear waste must not be exported to third countries.
It should introduce the financial tax and Eurobonds. I therefore voted for the Feio and Wortmann-Kool reports while I abstained on the Ferreira, Ford and Haglund reports and I voted for the Goulard report (for Eurobonds). A choice of votes that is intended to reflect my very mixed feelings over this package, which admittedly does offer some steps forward but which is still too poorly balanced: Europe will be unable to continue to develop without its people and therefore we must debate solutions for the future in public.
It was also clear during the mission that we made to Bulgaria and Romania, and for this I would like to thank my fellow Romanian Members, Mr Marinescu, Mr Enciu and Mrs Weber, and my fellow Bulgarian Members, Mr Kovatchev and Mrs Nedelcheva.
It will be a way for us to be able genuinely to exchange best practices. I believe that in the long term, this will constitute one firm basis for economic growth in Europe, but more important than economic growth is to remember that it is via this process that people, young people, can grow as individuals and Europeans.
It would be appropriate that, in areas of exclusive competence, the EU should be the pre-eminent actor, with full membership, while the Member States might also - but not necessarily - be present as members, without, in most cases, an independent role.
Its application must also guarantee environmental and social sustainability, and should not distort competition between Member States.
Just one element of these costs is, of course, EU over-regulation.
Ladies and gentlemen, the current trends pose a threat to the future of the EU and to the prosperity and well-being of Europeans.
Last year, 2010, we reviewed the existing situation of volunteering, through bilateral meetings, surveys and a dedicated conference in September 2010.
Lastly, for the future, we propose in this report to double the amount of research funding in order to create this European research area, with the help of the European Research Council.
Legislation coming from Europe has a massive impact on the lives of those living within its borders and we must use every opportunity to ensure this legislation is as fair and balanced as possible.
Let me make it clear: a right-thinking Member State such as the Netherlands will never be able to agree with this report. MEPs with a fresh, freedom-loving vision should throw this report straight in the bin.
Let us express our deepest respect for all of the victims of expulsions and deportations, but let us be united in committing ourselves to continuing European unification as the only real guarantee against a policy that brought so much misery to the people of Europe and beyond during the last century.
Let us send a strong signal to the European Commission and Europe's agricultural producers, showing our support for a fairer, simpler and more flexible CAP.
Lithuania's goal of improving transport infrastructure and accessibility (23% of the entire allocation of Structural Fund money), enhancing its R&D capacity (22%), and supporting business creation, depends on cohesion policy.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are going to give our verdict at first reading on the draft radio spectrum policy programme, and I should like to thank the Commission for having supported and transformed this proposal, which was first tabled during our debates on the telecoms package.
Madam President, I would like to ask Mr Kirkhope this question because he agrees that the European Arrest Warrant needs review and re-evaluation - my view would be a lot stronger than that, but never mind.
Madam President, as I have already had the opportunity to state to both the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I cannot but express my disappointment at the failure of conciliation, notwithstanding our best efforts to find an agreement.
Madam President, it is untenable to say that the constitution of a Member State is a matter only for itself.
Madam President, the European Arrest Warrant has become one of the most successful instruments on mutual recognition adopted within the European Union.
Madam President, when the former Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came into office, there were major question marks against the relevance and effectiveness of the IMF.
Many of the provisions of this constitution are very partisan, such as the omission of protection of gay people from discrimination and the giving of extra votes to mothers.
Measures such as a European patent and the European professional identity card must be strengthened and applied widely in order to strengthen competitiveness and employment.
Mention has already been made of the short timescale for the trade preference relaxation, reduced from three years to one year: Pakistan is prevented from maintaining or increasing duties or charges within that time.
More recent analysis conducted in 2010 shows that the costs of meeting the 20% greenhouse gas reduction target have fallen by at least one third compared to the analysis made in 2008.
Moreover, in order to support their business, I invite the European Commission to implement the principle of reciprocity and to think of new ways of improving access by European companies to public procurement outside the Union, in order to ensure equal conditions for European and foreign companies who are competing for the allocation of public contracts.
Moreover, the results achieved will convince the whole of Europe that it has successfully enhanced the security of the entire Union.
Most of these increases coincide with the areas with the highest level of irregularities.
Mr Garriga Polledo's report sets out to define the European Parliament's political priorities for the Multiannual Financial Framework for the period after 2013, both in terms of legislation and the budget.
Mr President, Commissioner Barnier is currently in the United States meeting with his counterparts and he has asked me to convey to you the following statement in reply to Wolf Klinz's own-initiative report on rating agencies, which was adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in March.
Mr President, Commissioner, no one could disagree with what you have said. I wish to relate the trouble suffered by a fellow Greek, who complained to me about a similar misadventure as the result of misleading advertising and gave me all the relevant documents.
Mr President, I had the honour to be the rapporteur in this House when the European Arrest Warrant was approved in 2001 and 2002.
Mr President, I would also like to protest against the language being used here, against terms of abuse such as 'populists', 'extremists' and the like, for people who simply want to protect the borders of their country.
Mr President, Mrs McGuinness made an important point just now, namely that there is a moral and ethical dimension to this issue, given all the public health, biodiversity and economic concerns we have raised.
Mr President, first allow me to thank the Committee on Budgetary Control, and in particular the rapporteur Mr Chatzimarkakis, for their excellent cooperation and the report he has drawn up, including the recommendation that the budget for 2009 should be discharged. I would also like to thank Mr Staes for his report on the implementation of the European Development Fund, and Mr Stavrakakis for his report on agencies.
Mr President, in this case, too, the text is included in the voting list. I would just like to make one comment: the subject is the protest against the condemnation of demonstrators in Bahrain and criticism of that conduct.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report is a proper, reasonable offer by Parliament to the Commission and Council for the further development of the budgetary basis of the European Union in difficult times.
Mr President, thank you for your kind words of solidarity.
Mr President, the long-running military conflict between the government forces and the armed groups of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, which has had very cruel consequences for the civilian population living in the conflict zones, came to an end in 2009.
Mr President, this week's European Council has a very substantive agenda.
Mr President, with regard to Camp Ashraf, we can do nothing less than join in the condemnation of the human rights violations that have taken place there.
Mrs Harms and Mr Turmes, it is simply not acceptable to spend your time permanently complaining and heckling and then, when you are called on to do something, to vote against better safety levels for nuclear power plants.
My colleague Mr Eickhout has highlighted the numerous benefits to the EU of having more ambitious targets, and moves within this parliament to reduce our ambitions will be rejected by Europe's citizens.
My personal view is that it is important, in this context, for us to convey a clear message to the European Union's other trade partners.
My vote in favour is based on the wisdom of this report, which not only embraces the innovations of the Treaty of Lisbon in matters of foreign policy and security, but also calls for greater coordination between the recently created European External Action Service, the Member States and the Commission.
Nevertheless, I urge the Executive Director of the Agency to fully fulfil his obligation to include, in his report to the discharge authority summarising the Internal Audit Service (IAS) Report, all recommendations made (including the ones which could be possibly refused by the Agency) and all action taken on these recommendations; I call therefore on the Executive Director of the Agency to provide information on the content of the IAS's four 'very important' recommendations and the action taken by the Agency.
Nevertheless, we must make every effort to ensure that these policies promote the values and interests of the EU at international level, with the general aim of contributing to peace, to security, to solidarity, to conflict prevention, to the promotion of democracy, to the protection of human rights, to gender equality, to respect for international law, to support for international institutions, to effective multilateralism and mutual respect between nations, to sustainable development, to free and fair trade, and to the eradication of poverty.
No, this is a proposal that the European Commission has made with respect to the massive flooding in Pakistan, time-bound for two years, with the possibility of its being continued for another year.
Not all MEPs are back in the Chamber after the fire drill.
Now is perhaps the time, he said, for Plan B - something, I hasten to add, that the Committee on International Trade has been looking for for a long time.
Now, in these turbulent times, a new competent Managing Director must therefore be appointed for an important global institution such as this and the process must be open.
Of course I can understand that the increase in fuel prices could worsen the problem, but the main reason for the problem has always been overfishing - the fishing over the set limits which cannot leave stocks in a healthy state.
Of course, there is a group of countries who are fiercely against it. This was also very visible here during the debate. I must just remind you that on 15 October, the Council agreed on the political compromise.
On 14 April 2011, the Commission adopted a proposal for a decision on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in favour of Belgium, with a view to supporting the reintegration into the labour market of workers made redundant as a result of the global financial and economic crisis.
On both sides, here it is not a matter of supplying arms, but rather of peaceful mediation between the two sides.
On the contrary, until the spring events, Azerbaijan was making relatively good progress and was not listed by Human Rights Watch among such poorly-viewed states as China, Iraq, Israel, Russia, Saudi Arabia or Uzbekistan.
On the other hand, I am convinced that the cooperation and verification mechanism - the famous CVM on which the Commission will release a report in July, dealing with the exact same issues that were voiced in this debate - could be helpful, even if officially, it is not part of the conditions for Schengen accession.
On the other hand, unilateral violation of the agreement must be prevented at all costs, since this threatens the construction of a European area without borders, which started in 1985.
On top of this, they have an essential role in combating climate change due to their capacity to absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen.
One final question: tax evasion.
One of the most controversial issues in this debate is whether or not to authorise the export of nuclear waste to countries outside the EU. I clearly supported the option of prohibiting exports to third countries, contrary to initial proposals. I also supported the proposal not to allow exports of waste other than for recycling, on the express condition that they should subsequently be imported back into the EU. This position was supported by a majority and I am glad of this.
One was the speech by a Member from the United Kingdom of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe whose party is part of the coalition government in the UK. This party was opposed to nuclear power before the elections and supported it afterwards and this is the person who is criticising my thoroughness when it comes to the stress tests. I can only say that this speech would have been more appropriate at the party conference in London than it was here in Strasbourg.
Operators often seek to benefit from inadequate inspections in order to get round the ban and smuggle the waste through other Member States where the inspections are less rigorous, as you said.
Our cities are a central aspect of our key European objectives, although we must not ignore rural areas. I will never get tired of saying that if we are to improve energy efficiency we must begin in the cities.
Our primary objective must be to ensure high-quality and sustainable food production in Europe and for our rural areas to be active and vital.
Overarching frequency planning and management at European level is, without doubt, less appropriate for achieving this goal, as the Commission itself also stresses that this can be carried out well and efficiently in the individual Member States. A coordinating role would certainly be desirable, however.
Parliament has just given the Commission the green light to continue talks with the WTO but has insisted on restricting their duration and scope.
Parliament was the first European institution to broach the subject of the increasing number of lobbies at European level, having launched the register for representatives of interest groups in 1996.
Parties should cooperate to establish an information-sharing mechanism, preferably coordinated by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), in conjunction with other relevant multilateral and intergovernmental initiatives, and to facilitate the exchange of information with existing databases relevant to the agreement.
Perhaps, the Commissioner could explain once again when the Office will actually be up and running.
Poor economic statistics could be one of the reasons for the crisis.
Preventive actions are crucial in this respect, as they allow for situations to be prevented without ex post actions having to be taken. I agree with the report when it supports the Commission's approach and extends the use of reversed qualified majority voting to block a Commission decision in the Council.
Public acceptance and understanding are nowadays an integral part of EU policy and form the basis for the EU's functioning.
Rather, it is proof of the complex situation in Egypt. I therefore believe that close monitoring by the European Parliament - especially through Commissioner Ashton's statement - is absolutely necessary.
Regarding the Southern Neighbourhood: the European Council is expected to endorse the new approach to relations with the EU neighbours which was agreed at Monday's Foreign Affairs Council.
Reinforced economic governance in Europe is simply too important to fail on this final remaining issue.
Respect for International Labour Organisation standards, the principles laid down in the European Social Charter and social dialogue are just some of the areas that can be discussed on these occasions. I believe that the report we have adopted offers sound backing for these objectives.
Russia is one of Europe's most important economic partners, not to mention a neighbouring country on which, inter alia, European energy policy depends.
Second: the European Union will impress upon Russia that more progress needs to be made on agreeing substantial trade and investment provisions, including on energy, in the new EU-Russia Agreement in order to provide a solid legal basis for deepened economic cooperation in the years to come.
Secondly, in the light of the call in the report for steps to remove barriers to mobility, I would highlight the fact that a Council recommendation designed to encourage Member States to do precisely this is due to be adopted by the Council in the coming days.
Secondly, the role of the Commission, as highlighted by the Commissioner, is praiseworthy; and, thirdly, the point made by Paul Rübig that a new regulator should oversee the stress tests and any future power plants that are built would be very sensible.
Serving the harmonious development of the EU is one of the objectives of cohesion policy, which is an indispensable instrument for reinforcing the economic, social and territorial reality of Europe, as well as an essential factor for the realisation of smart and inclusive growth as anticipated in the Europe 2020 strategy. I support this report as I feel that territorial cohesion should be adequately supported through the allocation of greater structural funds, and it is therefore right that the share allocated to Objective 3 be increased from the current 2.5% to 7%, considering in addition that around 37.5% of the European population lives in border regions.
Should we not draw lessons from what is happening in what are called the Arab countries and not demand of our Eastern partners what we did not demand of some governments, notably those of Tunisia, Libya or Egypt? Should we not, Mr Andor, see to it that democracy can finally rule in those countries, that we have minimum requirements in the matter?
Since consultations on the horizontal proposal concerning the country of origin in trade policy have not ended yet, it did not seem appropriate for us to create a precedent that would jeopardize the proposal and prejudice the outcome of that debate.
Since these practices are carried on across frontiers, it is very difficult to bring those responsible to justice.
So I would like to thank everybody for this useful debate once again, it is good that now we have a schedule concerning the future as well, and it is very important for us that, as several Members have indicated, we can combat counterfeiting as efficiently as possible and that the European consumer can trust the traceability of textile products.
So this is a first data point for evaluation, provided that we agree that the target of the programmes is to overcome the budgetary and economic crisis and not to create a culture of punishment leading to euro-scepticism in Europe.
So, integrating training and education, infrastructure around housing programmes, opportunities for small businesses to grow, working with UN women - as I am - to consider how we build safer communities around the housing projects, how we work together to design a much bigger, grander vision that is built upon what the Egyptian people want. I am talking to the Foreign Minister of Egypt, Al-Araby, who is committed to working closely with us on the Middle East Peace Process, keen to develop the strength of the relationship that we already have, and keen to see us as partners in collaborating in the region.
Some members of the currency union are paying for the irresponsibility or adventurism of others, and a move towards greater transparency and clearer budgetary rules leading to the avoidance of long-term problems in our countries has therefore become essential.
South Sudan must be enabled to establish itself as a viable sovereign state.
Stigmatisation and incitement to hatred on the grounds of religious affiliations are considered offences in France and this situation is equivalent to flagrante delicto.
Such action should include brokering an agreement between Rajoelina and Ravalomanana, allowing the former president to return to Madagascar without any risk or prejudice.
Surely we are not going to allow the will of two Heads of State to jeopardise one of Europe's greatest achievements.
Temporary emergency measures are needed that will enable European fishers to overcome their difficult economic situation, but the Commission should also draw up a medium- and long-term plan aimed at improving fuel efficiency in the fisheries sector, including aquaculture.
Thanks to these and strict adherence to the rules established by the new Stability and Growth Pact, I am sure that the EU will gain in strength and will be able to face new challenges without assistance policies and, worse still, outdated slogans that lead nowhere and do only damage, especially among the weakest members of society.
That is also why we need a genuinely and effectively functioning mechanism to identify and correct macroeconomic imbalances, in order to prevent the kind of crises we have seen, for instance in Ireland or the credit boom we have seen in Spain.
That is the core of the problem, and now we are living out the consequences and we are at a turning point.
That is why I agree with the rapporteur that it is time to act now and to see what positive action we can take.
That is why it is so important to promote freedom of movement for workers within the Union.
That is why we in the Group of the Greens want the EU2020 objectives to be fully binding in the Stability and Growth Pact and in the reports, and also the deficit and debt objectives.
That really is my huge topic right now, so I urge the Commissioner to please keep on track and focus also on the future, to create something like a statute for internships which establishes rules against exploitation ...
That, of course, includes access to social security, health and safety protection and maternity protection, as well as provisions on working and rest time.
The Action Plan on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Applications outlines the steps that are essential to the GNSS passing a turning point and guaranteeing project success.
The CETA will also cover regulatory barriers such as sanitary and phytosanitary measures, customs procedures and competition rules.
The Commission for Petitions regrets the fact that Directive 2006/114/EC on misleading and comparative advertising, which is applicable to business-to-business transactions, seems either to fall short of providing effective counter-measures or to be insufficiently implemented by Member States.
The Commission is analysing the results of the public consultation and then it will prepare a detailed impact assessment to see what should be the next step that, in times of crisis, will be good for giving a boost to the Internal Market and creating growth and jobs in the Internal Market by expanding the markets, mostly for SMEs, and giving consumers the possibility of better choice and better deals.
The Commission must therefore put pressure on the Member States to persuade them to assume responsibility for the funds that the EU allows them to manage.
The Commission therefore very much appreciates Parliament's approach, focusing on the long-term benefit of investing in early years learning.
The Commission's stand is marked by confusion, cover-up and panic and, as a result, we are mourning lives, we are mourning cases of illness and we are mourning the consequences to agricultural production.
The Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left agrees with the general parts of the resolution, but has serious doubts over the points specifically mentioned, and therefore will not support the resolution.
The Council should also participate in the common register, which should be made mandatory and serve as a dynamic instrument in guaranteeing the transparency of the decision-making process.
The Digital Agenda and the digital economy represent one of the most important objectives of the EU 2020 strategy, aimed at closing the digital gap, and increasing the productivity, cohesion and competitiveness of European industry, and ensuring better access to the single market for the EU's consumers and companies.
The EU cannot forget its role in every respect as a leading actor on the world stage.
The EU is an ageing society, and therefore the influx of migrants should not be regarded only as a threat to European labour markets.
The EU should support the initiatives of young and talented people to promote particular political strategies. A good example of such activity is the website Eastbook.eu, whose founders supply thousands of Internet users every day with information about events in the countries of the Eastern Partnership and the progress of the programme.
The Europe 2020 strategy has been agreed, its priorities are clear and its objectives are measurable.
The European Commission worked around the clock to be able to issue a positive report on 10 June. I can assure you that both the Croatians and the Hungarian Presidency have been working day and night to make this happen.
The European Parliament and the Council invite the Commission, when drawing up the report pursuant to Article 24a of the regulation, to consider their impact on possible new labelling requirements including with a view to improving the traceability of textile products'. That is all and now the Minister will nod I hope.
The European SME Week in October will be a good opportunity to work together to raise awareness of SME policy and the needs of SMEs everywhere in the European Union.
The European Union must have greater political strength and not just economic strength.
The European Union, through its funding for research and innovation, and through its support to agriculture but also to regional development, contributes in a very tangible manner to boosting the European economies.
The Fund must concentrate its efforts on creating employment, promoting lifelong learning, helping in particular low-skilled workers, those outside the labour market, along with the most vulnerable groups, those who suffer discrimination and, of course, SMEs.
The ILO plays an essential role on the international scene by drawing up, promoting and translating these standards into reality.
The Member States are currently implementing tough national budgetary consolidation policies, and these policies have to find an important balance between the need to tackle the crisis and the need to relaunch the economy and investment.
The Parliament was the first European institution to address the phenomenon of an increasing number of interest groups at European level and, especially, the consequences of this evolution for the legislative process.
The Schengen acquis is, therefore, a fundamental instrument for the legal economy, and I am convinced that on 24 June this year, the Council will take important points for reflection from what is intended to be a strengthening of trust and collaboration between Member States.
The Structural Funds are one of the main tools for implementing the economic and social policy of the Union.
The UN's Darusman report, which is the immediate pretext for this debate, states clearly that in those final stages, the LTTE used the civilian population as human shields, intensified the forcible recruitment of civilians, including children, into its ranks, executed civilians who attempted to escape the conflict zone and deployed artillery in proximity to displaced civilians and civilian installations such as hospitals.
The abolition of internal border control is particularly important for the entire European Union and each Member State individually.
The adverse scenario proposed by the banking authority, the EBA, envisages a significant shock in the form of price fluctuations of sovereign debt and the cost of its financing.
The aim is to lay down rules regulating the content, presentation, examination and monitoring of stability programmes and convergence programmes, as part of the multilateral surveillance to be carried out by the Commission and the Council at an early stage.
The alignment of study programmes and corresponding mutual recognition must be achieved in all areas of training and education, in particular, in manual trades, where there is a lot of ground to make up.
The arrangement of higher duties during peak hours, compensated for during off-peak hours, is now much better elaborated than in the Council position.
The basis for this is the mutual recognition of qualifications and courses of education and training. I abstained from the vote on this report as it fails to propose any tangible solutions to the issue of how mutual recognition is to take place where, of course, in many fields, there are qualitatively highly differing methods of education and training.
The changes made to the common agricultural policy will therefore not be merely qualitative - improving the targeting of our objectives - they will also aim to distribute payments among the Member States - both within the Member States themselves and among the various categories of farms - precisely in order to make better use of the available resources in terms of the objectives that have been set.
The common register will be a step forward towards greater transparency in the European institutions, which hopefully will help give the European project greater legitimacy in the eyes of its citizens.
The conservation of forest heritage represents an important contribution to the welfare of populations, as well as contributing to job creation in rural areas.
The credit cards of the main local organiser of the civil society event - which is, by the way, the first ever linked to an EU-Russia Summit - have been blocked (for technical reasons, of course), and her car licence plates have mysteriously disappeared.
The current economic, financial and social crisis has demonstrated that the European Union's current economic governance model has not worked: the surveillance framework has shown itself to be very weak and the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact have not been respected. I therefore support the package of measures that the European Commission has tabled on economic governance. I am voting for the Ford report on requirements for budgetary frameworks of the Member States. I welcome the fact that the regulation will be applicable to all EU Member States. I would stress the need for means of independent oversight to be established. I welcome the possibility that governments that have just come to power might have the right to update their budgetary framework in the medium term to reflect new political priorities.
The debate has, above all, been a high quality one and it has focused on the following: we want to strengthen and maintain our current mobility programmes which are part of the lifelong learning and Youth on the Move programmes.
The detention camp in Guantánamo Bay is a reflection of this tragic situation.
The directory companies play on that uncertainty.
The economic and financial crisis has exposed and reinforced the need for coordination and improved surveillance of economic policies within the economic and monetary union.
The emerging powers and the emerging economies of this world are not waiting for Europe to split into its constituent parts, from large parts like Germany down to very small parts like Malta, in the belief that each individual part will be able to survive on its own - the renationalisation rhetoric that many politicians are giving their people.
The examples in North Africa make us realise now that the EU's need for military preparedness and capability at the gates of Europe remains a fact.
The fact is that even now the lobby register only covers 2 800 of the 20 000 lobbyists in Brussels.
The failure to conclude this dossier came despite a number of positive steps achieved on the issue of cloning during the last months and hours of negotiations.
The financial year 2010 showed clearly how sensitive and important the publication of results is in terms of consistency.
The first thing I want to say is that some Members of this House need to show a little humility and a little common sense, because they make it appear that they are the only ones that have ever thought about nuclear safety and the only ones who are worried about the future of their children and humanity.
The fundamental aspect of European culture is that it is not intended to be promoted in external relations in a simplified way, but as something vibrant and alive thanks to its particular features.
The government of Sri Lanka and the Commission have set up the LLRC to investigate human rights allegations.
The impact assessment instrument presented by the rapporteur is a good way of improving the quality of law making at European level.
The information is intended to provide a basis for analysing the demand for drugs, ways of reducing it, and the drug market in general.
The intransigence, in the past, of those who handled the European Constitution prevented us from institutionalising European referenda.
The key factor to achieving this goal is for developed countries to want to open their markets to developing countries, which also includes India.
The legal protection offered by the bilateral investment treaties (BITs) is important in ensuring that businesses are encouraged to take the step of investing abroad, which can cost many millions.
The main objective of the Agreement is to minimise the duplication of assessments, tests and controls, unless these reflect significant regulatory differences, and to enable both the EU and Canada to rely on each other's certification systems.
The measures put to the vote today seek to strengthen the instruments that are not working, and therefore it is essential that they are put into practice.
The most effective way we can promote development is to enable people to help themselves. I therefore welcome the abolition of customs barriers - no matter how temporary - and I am confident that this transitional period will allow us to evaluate the process proposed by the Commission.
The natural disaster suffered by the people of Pakistan last August touched all of us and deserves the solidarity of the European Union.
The new Hungarian constitution is an important instrument for clearing away the ruins left by eight years of corrupt and inept Socialist governance.
The new regulation on macroeconomic surveillance should deal with these two problems.
The next item is the report by Mr Dess, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the CAP towards 2020: meeting the food, natural resources and territorial challenges of the future.
The objectives set in the Digital Agenda in the form of broadband cover for all European citizens by 2013, and high-speed cover of 30 Mbps or more (up to 100 Mbps for half of European households) by 2020, must be regarded as the minimum, and the ambition should be for Europe to have the best capacity and the highest broadband connection speeds in the world.
The opportunities offered by public funding, particularly the Structural Funds, are not fully exploited.
The payments should include as few exemptions as possible, and should apply to the so-called external costs of road transport, including noise and, above all, emissions. I am frankly curious as to how the individual states will justify their unwillingness to introduce payments, at least under Table 1, which is a very watered-down version of what genuine environmentalists want.
The positives are that transaction costs are low, that partner countries have an increased responsibility for themselves and that there is a better dialogue between partners and donors.
The principal goal of the 'Youth on the Move' initiative is to promote youth mobility and to break down barriers that are still standing in its way.
The process must be evidence-based, impact-assessed and with full parliamentary involvement, and on that basis, as I have said, the time for talking is over and we need to move forward.
The proposal is based on the Euratom Treaty and, in particular, on the guidelines provided in the report 'Assessing Euratom - 50 years of European nuclear energy policy'. The rapporteur identifies four main priorities among the amendments tabled in the draft report for consideration by the members of the committee.
The proposed strengthening of the European Defence Agency would not mean a genuine increase in the level of security in the EU, but merely the creation of another bureaucratic monster, incapable of performing the tasks assigned to it. Who would take the decision to mobilise European armed forces? Whose interests would their units be acting in? How much of a say would the new Member States have? Would the EDA's headquarters be relocated? Fears have also been voiced regarding institutional matters, such as whether growth of the EDA would not result in a reduction in the size of certain Member States' armies, and whether there would be a clash with the remit and objectives of the European External Action Service.
The qualities that these frequencies possess in terms of coverage and penetration of buildings are universally recognised: they are called golden frequencies.
The rapporteur introduces the key idea of creating a union between all Europeans for innovation.
The reality is that this proposal will have a disproportionate impact upon the peripheral Member States in the European Union, such as Ireland, as centrally located Member States have the option of switching to rail.
The refugee problem cannot be automatically resolved by returning to a regime of border controls.
The report also fails to mention the withdrawal of sovereign debt from the agencies' ratings, which is the main measure that could be taken in this area to combat speculation against the euro.
The report calls for the strengthening of basic employment standards, which are enshrined in the conventions of the International Labour Organisation, including freedom of association and collective bargaining, the elimination of forced and compulsory labour, the elimination of discrimination in the workplace and the abolition of child labour.
The report is divided into five parts: security and foreign policy, security and defence, external and internal security, security through operations and security in partnership.
The report sets out various priorities, some of which are important and others less so, but in any case, they are all very expensive.
The request to increase the post-2013 EU budget by 5%, and therefore to increase the total European Union GNI from 1.06% to 1.11%, corresponds to a desire to honour commitments made to support growth and development, first and foremost, the Europe 2020 strategy, for which adequate resources are needed.
The restoration of the rule of law in Madagascar is an absolute priority and requires the organisation of free, transparent and democratic elections supported by international aid and, first and foremost, the European Union.
The rights of the emerging economies mean that it is in the fundamental interest of the European Union, its citizens and its Member States for us to be more united and thus more effective in advancing our causes and our interests on the global scene.
The scrapping of this symbolic euro on the altar of national self-interests and budgetary austerity illustrates Europe's moral and political failure.
The severely exploitative and discriminatory conditions under which many of those engaged in domestic work operate are well known.
The sovereign debt crisis will not be solved until the bank crisis is solved - and the bank crisis will not be solved until markets are confident in providing capital and liquidity to banks.
The substantive difference lies in the fact that this report makes no reference to the origin marking to be included on textile product labels.
The terms values and interests must be compatible, not exclusive in our external action.
The time has also come for the EU to use effective and creative measures to implement the aims set out in the Europe 2020 strategy, such as reducing the school drop-out rate to under 10% and ensuring that 40% of young people are educated to university level.
The two principles that define Europe are solidarity - we stand by this - and a sense of individual responsibility - that the Greek people and all those who receive acts of solidarity also take responsibility themselves.
The volume of toxic waste is continuously increasing in the EU. Because of the high cost of recycling and disposing of waste, there is an enormous temptation to ship this waste to countries with less stringent environmental controls and lower disposal costs. I am pleased to find that this problem is accepted by all sides of the House and hope that Parliament will take a concerted approach to this issue.
Their conservation represents an important contribution to the welfare of populations, as well as contributing to job creation in rural areas.
There are also other aspects that I want to highlight here, which concern other reports.
There are other ways of showing solidarity: more effective forms of aid, aimed at re-establishing the affected areas and improving the living conditions of the affected people; based on a policy of effective and lasting development cooperation and aid, which supports the integrated and sustainable development of local communities.
There could be a major event where Member States, under very clear circumstances, need to do this.
There is a large and growing resident population of foreign hauliers using foreign vehicles and paying only their own countries' modest vehicle charges who are taking more and more domestic business.
There is also a need for enhanced market access, including the modernisation of the standardisation system within the EU, and for better access for small and medium-sized enterprises to public procurement opportunities.
There is no doubt that the scale of the economic meltdown in Greece, coupled with the risk of a similar crisis hitting many other Member States, urgently requires a strategy to prevent such a disaster from happening again.
There is precious little time and there is a heavy responsibility on the European Commission, and certainly more now on the Member States, who are weakening and backing off from what they promised initially after what happened in Japan.
There needs to be a rapid and adequate exchange of information through the Schengen Information System (SIS), good police cooperation and effective controls in place at the external borders.
There will thus be more opportunity to adapt interventions according to the demands of each Member State.
Therefore, I do not quite understand the Commissioner's criticism of some of the compromises that are being tabled again here, as we refer to the Treaty and you are the ones who interpret how it is to be applied.
Therefore, as a Parliament, we need to be clear on what our priorities are and be prepared to fight for them.
Therefore, our resolution calls urgently on all EU institutions and on the Member States to do everything possible to prevent Mr al-Nashiri from being executed.
Therefore, there would only be limited political support from Member States for a proposal that could lead to an increase in public expenditure.
Therefore, with proper use of the arrest warrant, proportionality, strict application of the instrument, better exchange of information and training on European issues for magistrates, we are sure that uniform application of this important instrument can be achieved in full.
These are the latest steps in this process of interference and extortion, which is openly colonial in complexion.
These deportations were chiefly designed to deprive Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania of their social and political elite.
These issues are the subject of other evaluations, such as the European Commission's Cooperation and Verification Mechanism. I want to welcome also the suggestions made by Commissioner Malmström yesterday regarding a new package of anti-corruption measures.
These provisions of the partnership thereby make it possible to operate in conjunction with local authorities, creating important jobs; they also permit Europe to be present in otherwise prohibited areas, thereby facilitating the development of practices of 'good fishing' and making it possible to monitor the presence and quantity of the fish stocks concerned.
These two proposals to amend directives are crucial to the survival of European manufacturing companies.
They are not ready now, and they never will be.
They have demonstrated that they are ready to join, that they have made the necessary progress, and hopefully there will very soon be a possibility to achieve a way forward and a decision by the Council.
They only asked for one thing.
They will then be fleshed out in 2012. I want to urge the Commission to really give this a high priority and not allow it to depend on the Member States, which are too slow to put the right measures in place.
Thirdly, the programmes in both Greece and Ireland are still in the relatively early stages.
This Eurovignette is only a tiny step forward towards that goal.
This also affects our assistants, and it has come to my attention that our assistants are much more indignant than even the Members. I would therefore ask the assistants, who work very hard in Parliament, also to understand the need for these checks.
This can only be achieved if not only the tariff barriers but also the non-tariff and technical barriers to trade are removed.
This creates legal uncertainty for the victims, as they often do not know what the legal status is of such contracts in another country.
This draft Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Croatia on the participation of the Republic of Croatia in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) is important as Croatia is one of the main entry points for drugs in Europe.
This grants the Commission discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the Eighth, Ninth and Tenth European Development Funds for the financial year 2009.
This hell-hole must be shut down immediately with all of the current detainees having access to fair trial before a civilian court, all of the secret CIA torture prisons in Europe must be shut down, the use of Shannon airport in Ireland for military and rendition flights by the CIA must be ended, and the barbaric death penalty must be brought to an end.
This is a balanced approach, as the opinion recognises the progress made by these two countries in terms of the criteria which must be satisfied for integration into the Schengen area (control of land, sea and air borders, visas, police cooperation, readiness in terms of connecting to and using the Schengen Information System and data protection), but also requires regular progress reports on certain issues which are considered to be outstanding.
This is a problem of recognisability, of traceability and of inadequate controls at EU level.
This is also reinforced, however, by an attempt to legitimise the system of sanctions, with an attempt to include a system of incentives.
This is because, in my opinion, the EU should refrain from imposing social prerogatives on third countries, however correct or beneficial they may deem them to be. Whilst I accept the importance of fostering humane methods of treating a workforce, social policy in the EU has already wreaked havoc on a number of UK institutions and should not be extended. A degree of flexibility and freedom is needed when dealing with social policy, as one-size-fits-all policy making can be counterproductive when applied at domestic level.
This is my 12th discharge exercise. I believe this must be the first time that we have worked together in such a constructive spirit; not only Commissioner Šemeta, but also individual commissioners in charge of their own remits have really invested time on this discharge.
This is part of the campaign consisting of promotion material showing a foetus with the words 'Let me live', with the Commission's logo. I made it very clear: this campaign is not in line with the Progress programme and it is not in line with the project proposal submitted to the Commission services by the Hungarian authorities.
This is the case at the moment in Romania, even in the region I come from, with regard to the radioactive landfill from the Kozloduy power station.
This is to defend the immunity of Mr de Magistris, as in giving the interview in question Mr de Magistris was acting in performance of his duties as an MEP and carrying out political activities by expressing his opinion on a matter of public interest to his constituents.
This is why I supported Mrs Niebler's report on the necessary changes to impact assessments, particularly regarding the introduction of an independent mechanism.
This is why we also need to look at the European budget as part of one system: both for economic governance and for managing the single currency.
This kind of action is totally unacceptable.
This means that, in many situations, GDP can increase while the majority of a country's citizens become poorer, because GDP does not take into consideration the level of inequality in a society.
This new directive, which comprises the fusion of four already existing directives, aims to give new impetus to completing the internal market by removing legal obstacles to cross-border trade.
This point was made several times just now.
This proposal was tabled by the Commission at the express request of the European Council in the immediate aftermath of the floods that hit Pakistan in the summer of last year and brought widespread devastation to the country and to its people.
This report advocates the creation of a single strategic framework for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the other Structural Funds, particularly the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and the European Fisheries Fund (EFF), for the next financing period after 2013, along with its coordination with other instruments of the external aspects of EU policy.
This report contains several proposals to achieve this: the proposal to designate a person in every EU representation in third countries, for example, to coordinate cultural relations and interaction between the EU and those countries, or the proposal that the draft European External Action Service (EEAS) organisational chart contain posts tailored to cultural aspects and that a coordination unit be set up. Moreover, it seems opportune that third countries be involved to a greater extent in EU programmes devoted to culture as much as mobility, youth, education and training: the accessibility to these programmes on the part of young nationals of those countries must be facilitated.
This report is on the cultural dimensions of the EU's external actions. I agree with the rapporteur in that we need a common strategy for the cultural dimension.
This report relates to the proposal for a directive of Parliament and of the Council on indications or marks identifying the lot to which a foodstuff belongs, in a codified text.
This report, drafted by our fellow Member, Mr Coelho, concerns the draft Council decision on the full application of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in the Republic of Bulgaria and Romania.
This revision is also a first step towards the reintroduction of fair competition between European road hauliers, since some Member States, such as France and Germany, already apply the 'polluter pays' principle and want the EU to extend it to all the others.
This sort of reform and change to the selection process would correspond to the reform of the IMF, which would also correspond to the changes in global economic relations and would give the developing countries a chance to bring their experience with the IMF to bear in the further development of the IMF.
This vote is the fruit of two years of discussions with consumer and professional associations, and it is, in particular, a major victory for the European Parliament which remained united around this issue.
This will be made possible in particular by expanding online administration and the one-stop shop in line with the recommendations made in the review.
This will provide consumers with more comprehensive and truthful information than under current legislation on origin marking and avoid them being misled.
This, coupled with the 25th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, which struck Ukraine on 26 April 1986, is a reminder to European leaders of their responsibility regarding nuclear safety in Europe.
Three exercises co-financed with funds from our financial instrument for civil protection had a radiological component, namely TORCH, which dealt with an accident resulting in mass fatalities and its simulation, CREMEX, which involved a mass contamination in the form of a dirty bomb, and SISMICAEX, implemented one year ago, which dealt with a nuclear accident caused by an earthquake.
Throughout the world, and in poor countries in particular, domestic services are among the lowest paid jobs.
To Mr Verhofstadt, I have to say this.
To begin with, I consider it essential that this new instrument continue to prioritise achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In order to achieve this aim - specifically, the eradication of poverty - it is essential that any future instrument be provided with realistic and adequate financial resources.
To get to the heart of the matter, the energy mix remains a matter for the national governments and parliaments.
To that end, the EU must make the necessary resources available to both countries to support social services such as education, health, agriculture, food security and institutional capacity building, and it should maintain this humanitarian aid for both countries after 9 July, the date on which South Sudan will officially gain its independence.
Today in the European Parliament, we voted on the Coelho report on the application of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in Bulgaria and Romania.
Today, Parliament adopted the amended text of the Consumer Rights Directive of my fellow Member, Mr Schwab. I welcome the adoption of this directive which will contribute to strengthening the platform of common consumer protection regulations, in particular with reference to the sale of goods online. I also welcome the fact that the legislator has allowed the Member States to include provisions that are more favourable to consumers in their respective national legal systems.
Together with the Federation of Food Banks, Secours populaire, the Red Cross and Restos du Coeur in France, I am concerned about the future of this programme after the European Court of Justice called into question its funding within the framework of the CAP.
Transport applications of the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (
Ukraine is not alone in this respect, but it must demonstrate its unconditional determination to introduce more comprehensive and more inclusive reforms if it wants to move closer to the EU. We will continue to provide Ukraine with significant support in its efforts to bring about internal reforms.
Unfortunately I have to point out a few difficulties reported by the Court of Auditors following the audits carried out during the implementation of the 2009 work programme. I therefore add my voice to the calls for the Authority to take the necessary measures to remedy these shortcomings which, in any case, have not nullified the general regularity and reliability of the budget for the financial year 2009.
Unfortunately, that is what the original proposal was like. I am pleased that we were able to rectify that.
Unlike you, we have always extended the hand of friendship to you, and we have always wanted decent coexistence, and we would therefore like the implementing regulations for your constitution to respect the sovereignty of neighbouring states in the region.
Vocational education and training make it possible to move around freely within the labour market, according to the changing economic situation and the demands of a particular economic sector.
We agree, furthermore, that all the parties should engage in continued and constructive dialogue to address post-referendum issues, including common borders, citizenship arrangements for citizens both north and south, and the sharing of oil revenues.
We also call for more money, to clear our conscience, but there is a lot of Arab money which is not invested in Arab democracy and Arab prosperity.
We also note the considerable progress that the Internet represents for our societies, even if it brings new challenges such as guaranteeing access for all and the economic model of the cultural sector.
We are also already planning the third batch, so the work is ongoing and will be continued.
We are calling for more resources to improve the infrastructure in our border regions and to strengthen the Trans-European Networks.
We are grateful to the Council for reintroducing visa sanctions and an asset freeze on the high Belarusian officials, which demonstrated that our deep concern for the people of Belarus is not only empty rhetoric.
We are now faced with the annual report on the common foreign and security policy (CFSP), this time relating to 2009.
We are strongly against the EU-India Free Trade Agreement because, even though that country is making progress in worker protection and health and in the fight against counterfeiting, we have to bear in mind that it is still an unfair competitor towards our businesses.
We are, of course, open to more efficient use and better implementation. I agree that mistakes, arrests of innocent people, etc., should be avoided.
We believe that the wording of the report which makes cohesion policy subject to conditions that force the Member States to implement reforms is unclear and liable to misinterpretation.
We can note a marked improvement in the situation of SMEs, but progress still needs to be made. SMEs continue to come up against considerable problems in expanding their activities, and sometimes even in surviving.
We cannot fail to express our concern about some of the principles guiding the European Research Area.
We could speak of cultural management or about giving a new impetus to the one-time idea of Melina Mercouri for a European Capital of Culture.
We do not understand why measures that are immediately relevant to exceptional situations have to be rejected.
We have EUR 28.5 billion left to programme in 2011, 2012 and 2013.
We have another resolution full of contradictions before us. On the one hand, the appointment of the new Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SME) Envoy by the Commission is to be welcomed, and his mandate to monitor the progress of the Member States in the implementation of the Small Business Act (SBA) and to promote SMEs' interests throughout the Commission, ensuring, in particular, that the 'Think Small First' principle is being applied effectively, is to be supported.
We have got to look at how we spend the money.
We have problems in many countries regarding the legal forms according to which the work is developing.
We have these epochal events - this economic crisis on our border, this collapse in our share of world GDP - and here we are talking about early years learning, about our responsibilities to the International Labour Organisation, and about whether Sarajevo should be a European city of culture.
We heard on the one hand from the Council that, if a European Arrest Warrant is executed properly and effectively and not in the many trivial cases we have seen, its advantages outweigh those disadvantages.
We know that not everything is as it should be with regard to Schengen.
We must also help our manufacturers when it comes to medicines, but I think that we will all agree that this must not be to the detriment of those who are dependent on access to cheap medicines.
We must encourage the Member States to adopt its guidelines so as to help SMEs at this time of crisis.
We must make every effort to improve efficiency and transparency and we must link this with an abandonment of unnecessary bureaucracy.
We must reinstate the requirement that a court will extradite a person only when there is compelling evidence that a serious offence under the extraditing country's laws has been committed.
We need a European leadership to stand up against simplistic solutions - and I have heard some of them here today - and populism.
We need research if we are to create jobs, and we need research, of course, to maintain employment in the EU and to remain competitive against the emerging economies.
We need to find a solution which satisfies our expectations but also takes into account the specific situation of India.
We need to realise that if we were to assume that cohesion policy is a policy only for the poorest, then it should slowly come to an end, which means it should slowly disappear completely from the list of European policies.
We now have a package before us. We have achieved a great deal.
We rely on the European Commission to achieve that and the European Parliament will be behind the Commission in strengthening Schengen, but if there are two lessons that we have learnt in respect of what happened in recent weeks they are these.
We should give serious consideration to the benefits of thorough, regular inspections coordinated at EU level, especially in the case of shipments to developing countries.
We should therefore reject this amendment.
We therefore have to make that choice in our external policy budget for the coming years. I await with curiosity the Commission's answer to a number of comments made by Mr Bart Staes in his excellent report.
We trust that the European Parliament's message will act as a guide and that unanimity will be achieved in the Council so that a final decision can be taken.
We want to put those proposals back on track.
We will examine this matter in depth in order to provide clear rules, prevent misleading information and facilitate responsible choices by consumers when purchasing textile products.
We would have preferred to lighten the penalties, but we had to agree to them as part of the compromises.
Well, I suppose in some ways, you may well need Mrs Lagarde because not only is Greece going bust, not only are we heading for the fourth bail-out, but as I have warned before in this Assembly, the validity of the European Central Bank itself will very shortly be called into question. I have warned that you cannot go on buying your own bad debt, but we have reached the point where, within weeks, we may well see that the ECB itself is not solvent, so perhaps your friend Mrs Lagarde can help bail that out as well.
What do we want to achieve? Innovation is not just a question of one building, one ministry, one programme.
What is more, better cooperation and coordination on development policy between Member States could save us EUR 6 billion.
What message do you have to send to these people who are seeking, in a dignified and peaceful manner, prospects and a better future for themselves, their families and their children?
What we instead need is a debate on measures to enhance Frontex so as to provide maximum security at the external borders of the European Union - thereby ensuring freedom of movement - and a debate on speedy asylum proceedings and managed migration, on cooperation to deal with the causes of migration and on readmission agreements.
When dealing with nuclear energy, safety and the transparency of procedures are two important issues which need to be constantly attended to. The answer is not necessarily to shut down plants, as Germany is planning to do, but rather to ensure that we are following the strictest safety programmes when it comes to dealing with this form of energy and the waste it produces.
When properly shaped in the budget, they could create room for much better and visibly better financing of what was under-financed - i.e. innovation, the management of migration flows, the external responsibilities of the European Union that are now so visible in the Mediterranean area, energy efficiency and, above all, how to connect Europe via the trans-European networks and the other cross-border connectors in energy systems.
When we started these free trade negotiations, there was a very positive attitude from everyone involved. I therefore believe it is important for us to ensure that we finish in exactly the same spirit and that we do not allow the negotiations to drag on for far too long.
